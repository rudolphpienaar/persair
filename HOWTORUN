#
# PRELIMINARIES
#
# The mongodb (and ui) services need to be instantiated first. These are
# "immortal" in as much as their lifetime continues beyond the epochs of
# persair.
#
# The persair application itself is dockerized and can be run from a
# container.
#

# Build (for fish shell syntax!)
set UID (id -u)
docker build --build-arg UID=$UID -t local/persair .

# Start up the mongodb (and ui)
docker-compose up

# Run persair (with support for source debugging)
docker run --rm -it --name persair                              \
        --network persair_pfair                                 \
        -e ReadWriteKey=tanguro                                 \
        -e DB=tanguro                                           \
        -e DBauthPath=/home/dicom/services/pfair.json           \
        -e URI=mongodb://pfair-db:27017                         \
        -v /home/dicom:/home/dicom                              \
